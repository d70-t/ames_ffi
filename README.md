Utilities for handling the NASA AMES File Format for Data Exchange.

These tools should assist in working with the NASA AMES file format.
The primary goal is to provide a reader which does not only read correctly
formatted AMES data file quickly, but also supports reading and correction
of many manually created, "nearly-correct" variants of the format.

The format specification of the NASA AMES File Format for Data Exchange
can be found [here](http://badc.nerc.ac.uk/help/formats/NASA-Ames/G-and-H-June-1998.html).
